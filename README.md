## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for managing the application's state.
- **Vite**: A fast and efficient front-end build tool for React applications.

## Important Note

- In this project, I've demonstrated my proficiency in both functional and class component development, showcasing my versatility in React programming.

- The functional components can be found in the following files:
  - `src/redux/actions.js`
  - `src/redux/actionTypes.js`

- The class components with lifecycle methods are located in:
  - `src/redux/reducer.js`
  - `src/redux/store.js`

- **Persisting Data on Reload:**
  - The application is designed to persist data even when the page is reloaded. This ensures a seamless user experience, and the data remains intact across sessions.

- **Redux for Global State Management:**
  - Redux is utilized for global state management in the application. It helps maintain a centralized state, making it easier to manage and share data across different components.

- **Organized Folder Structure:**
  - The project follows an organized folder structure to enhance code readability and maintainability. Key components and functionality are placed in logical directories for easy navigation.

- **Mobile Responsiveness:**
  - The application is designed to be responsive on mobile devices, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across various screen sizes.

These features collectively contribute to a robust and user-centric application.
Feel free to explore the codebase to see how I've leveraged both approaches to create a well-rounded React application.
