# Todo List App

Welcome to the Todo List App! This simple application helps you manage your tasks efficiently. Keep track of your to-dos and stay organized with ease.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for managing the application's state.
- **Vite**: A fast and efficient front-end build tool for React applications.

## Important Note

- In this project, I've demonstrated my proficiency in both functional and class component development, showcasing my versatility in React programming.

- The functional components can be found in the following files:
  - `src/redux/actions.js`
  - `src/redux/actionTypes.js`

- The class components with lifecycle methods are located in:
  - `src/redux/reducer.js`
  - `src/redux/store.js`

Feel free to explore the codebase to see how I've leveraged both approaches to create a well-rounded React application.


## Dependencies

- **redux**: State management library for React applications.
- **react-icons**: A library providing a collection of popular icons for React applications.
- **tailwindcss**: A utility-first CSS framework for easy styling and customization.
